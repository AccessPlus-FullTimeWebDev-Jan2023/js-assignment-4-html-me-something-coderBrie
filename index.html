         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hi My name is albiriari. That's how you say Briaris in Arabic. In my culture studying to understand the roots of my Ancestors is vital for self development. This has caused me to learn the Arabic version of my name, (albiriari).</p>

         <p> In my culture your Arabic name is an expression of appreciation to the Ancestors.
          It is a symbol of rememberance of who I AM. I understand that now, I AM what they prayed for me to be. &amp; Their sacrafice was not in vein.</p>

            <h2> My Hobbies </h2>
            <p> One of my favorite hobbies is Juicing. Cold pressed juice is a popular choice for hydration as it contains high amounts of water and essential nutrients. This type of juice is made using a hydraulic press to extract juice from fruits and vegetables without adding heat, which can destroy some of the nutrients. The cold pressing process helps to retain the enzymes, vitamins, and minerals present in the fruits and vegetables, making the juice a rich source of hydration and nutrition. Additionally, cold pressed juice is usually made with whole fruits and vegetables, including their skins and pulp, which contain dietary fiber that can help regulate digestion and promote satiety.</p>

            <p>One of the key benefits of drinking cold pressed juice for hydration is that it provides a quick and easy way to replenish fluids and nutrients in the body. When we sweat or engage in physical activity, our bodies lose water and electrolytes that need to be replenished to maintain optimal hydration. Cold pressed juice can help to provide these essential nutrients in a convenient and delicious form. Furthermore, the nutrients present in cold pressed juice can help to support the body's natural detoxification processes, which can help to reduce inflammation, boost immunity, and promote overall health and well-being.</p>

            <p>Juicing is an art form that involves extracting the juice from fruits and vegetables to create delicious and nutritious drinks. It requires a careful selection of ingredients, precise measurement, and an eye for color and texture. The process of juicing involves using a juicer to extract the juice from the produce while separating the pulp and fiber. The result is a smooth and refreshing drink that is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Juicing can be a creative and fun way to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet while enjoying the delicious taste of fresh juice. Whether you're a seasoned juicer or just starting, the art of juicing can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience.</p>
