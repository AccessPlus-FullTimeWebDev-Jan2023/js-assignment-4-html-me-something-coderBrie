         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hi My name is albirari. That's how you say Briaris in Arabic. In my culture studying to understand the roots of my Ancestors is vital for self development. This has caused me to learn the Arabic version of my name, (albiriari), In my culture your Arabic name is an expression of appreciation to the Ancestors. It is a symbol of rememberance of who I AM. I understand that I AM, what they prayed for me to be. & Their sacrafice was not in vein.</p>
